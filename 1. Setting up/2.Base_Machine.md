This part can be skipped.

We will create a machine and change some setups to things we like and then create an AMI. 

Then we will use those AMIs as base to create all our machines.

## Ubuntu

#### Creating the machine

First make sure you are in the correct zone that you want to create the Ubuntu machines. We will create the Ubuntu machines in US West (Oregon)

1. Launch Instances
2. Select the newest version of Ubuntu. I will be using "Ubuntu Server 20.04".
3. Choose type "t2.Micro". We are just going to change some setups.
4. Review and Launch

#### Terminal
1. Use any SSH client. I will be using Termius.
2. Launch the machine, you can use the pre-definied public IP because this is a temporary machine.
3. Let's enter the super user mode (root):
```
sudo su -
```
4. Let's update and upgrade the machine:
```
apt-get update && apt -y upgrade
```
5. Let's change some alias that can help us along the way:
```
nano .profile
```
Add these line at the bottom of the file:
```
mkdir -p ~/.nanobackups
alias nano='nano -T 4 -c -B -C ~/.nanobackups'
alias ll='ls -laFh'
alias rm='rm -i -v'
```
We are creating a folder called .nanobackups and changing three commands to our taste by using alias.

The alias nano, we are changing that (-T 4) the document is easily read, (-c) it shows which line and collum our cursors is, (-B) to make a backup of the edited file and (-C) to store the backup on the folder .nanobackups

The alias ll, we are changing the ls to (-l) shows us the file and directories in a listed way, (-a) to show us the hidden files and directories and (-h) to make the size number of files more human readable.

The alias rm, we are changing rm to (-i) always ask us if we want to delete the file and (-v) to show us which procedures the command has done.

6. Let's make sure our changes are running and functioning:
```
source .profile
```

7.
```
cd /etc/skel
```
```
nano .profile
```
```
mkdir -p ~/.nanobackups
alias nano='nano -T 4 -c -B -C ~/.nanobackups'
alias ll='ls -laFh'
alias rm='rm -i -v'
```
```
mkdir -p Maildir/{cur,new,tmp}
```
```
echo xfce4-session > ./.xsession
```
8. Exit the machine

### Creating the AMI

1. Stop the machine
2. Actions > Image and Templates > Create image
3. Give it a name you will remember
4. Create image
5. Delete the machine once the AMI is created and ready
